# [Project 1: Maven Environmental Challenge](https://lnkd.in/diP6_nJa)

This is a competition I took part in where the aim was to use the data provided to Visualize Apple's progress toward meeting their 2030 goal of reaching carbon neutrality across their corporate operations and entire product life cycle. 

* The dataset contained 3 tables, in CSV format.
* The "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" table contained the sources of Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022 divided by
 - category (corporate & product life cycle),
 - scope (direct scope 1 emissions & indirect scope 2 and 3 emissions), and
 - type (emissions & removals).
* The "Carbon Footprint by Product" table contained the emissions from the product life cycle of every baseline iPhone model released between 2015-2022.
* The "Normalizing Factors" table contains Apple's revenue, market cap, and employees during the same period.
